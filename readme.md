# Test Busters

A collection of test cases and conditions with proven expected results for building better software.

Presently Tim is building and testing a physics engine so that is where most of the emphasis is in Test Busters, however this project is built to provide good test cases for all sorts of situations from manipulating strings, time and dates to other things. Please stay tuned for further requirements and formatting of each test if you would like to contribute.
